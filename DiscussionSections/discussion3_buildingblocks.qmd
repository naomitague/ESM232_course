## Profit Mode {.scrollable}

Any questions from class

## Todays goal

Develop a profit model for your almond yield

Lets brainstorm on what a profit model might look like

Simpliest?

More complex?

## Profit Model Ideas {.scrollable}

-   profit = revenue - costs

-   revenue = price per unit \* yield

-   costs = fixed costs + variable costs

What might be fixed costs?

What might be variable costs?

Do you want price to be constant?

## Build a profit function

-   almond yield anomoly will be one input

But profit would depend on actual yield right?

Assume a baseline yield for your orchard (another input to your profit model)

-   profit will be the output

There may be other inputs depending on your profit model

# Construct your profit model

you can work in pairs or on your own

# Now put them together

-   there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions; you can have the profit function "call"/use the almond yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function)

# Now run your combined model and do some informal sensitivity analysis

-   which parameters might you vary?

-   graph how profit varies with your parameters

# Ojas will share an example
