# Teaching Approach

Class will include a mix of lectures and in class hands-on examples, using students’ own computers.

I will often provide a Quatro document for you to go through prior to class so you can learn at your own pace and

# Learning objectives

-   Gain familiarity with different types of models and the situations where you might use them

-   Understand how to choose the 'right model' for the job

-   Know how to build simple models including

    -   input-output models
    -   basic dynamic models
    -   matrix models

-   Gain some basic skills that are useful in applying models including

    -   parameter sensitivity analysis
    -   uncertainty analysis
    -   model calibration and evaluation

# Computing

-   I will assume that everyone has some basic R skills (from ESM 203, ESM 232, MEDS program courses or other courses), including how to use ggplot, and Quatro and build simple functions

-   Many classes will be working classes so bring laptop to class

-   Some of the material (example functions and Quatro code) will also be available on *github* I will also provide this material on *canvas* but if you are familiar with *git* then it may be faster to clone and then update the repository. We will discuss this further when we get to this part of the course

# ChatGPT and other AI-tools

[Interesting Paper on AI-tools in Computing Education](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3624720)

Tools

-   Github Copilot (most widely used by programmers)
-   ChatGPT

(both built from CODEX by OpenAI)

In 2020, test CODEX scored 78% on intro to computing test, in 2023 it scored 98%

Other studies show less accuracy...depends on the problem

# Using AI-tools in this course

-   AI-tools great resources but effective use requires understanding how to ask good questions

-   Use this course to build that understanding, think about the meta concepts. Ask yourself - What are situations you might apply a technique/idea/concept;

-   You gain skills by **Practicing**

-   For assignments/practice

    -   **Always** write the code yourself - but you use AI-tools to help find syntax
    -   Use AI-tools to explain other peoples code (including class examples)
    -   Use AI-tools to help interpret error messages

# Attendance

-   you are expected to come to class - its part of the learning (pair-share)

-   some assignments will be started and even completed in class

# Protocols and Guidance

-   Learning to program is hard and I may not always explain in a way that is accessible to you - So if you don't understand something *ASK*

-   Ideally ask in class - you will help me to learn how to explain (or find an answer if I don't know it) and you will help others

    -   if you don't feel comfortable asking , reach out to me or Ojas

-   Environmental modeling and the coding involved gets better with practice and play - Don't just read the Quatro - try the code, try variations on the ideas presented, make up stuff to try, get your feet wet

-   Programming means making mistakes, expect it, stay calm and try again - if you get frustrated step away and come back; be creative

-   **Respect and Support each other**

    -   when working in groups, pay attention to your partner, if they are not at your skill level, help them learn - recognize that we all have different backgrounds
    -   listen - different perspectives contribute to modeling - ask questions; figure out how different people *see* the world (what is there conceptual model)
    -   you learn by helping others - do that!

-   If you are really struggling, reach out to Ojas or myself, we can help (or if you just want to chat about something )

# Coding Best Practices

-   clear, readible (well-documented) code

-   informative variable and function names

-   graphs that are easy to understand (labels, legends, strategic use of color)
