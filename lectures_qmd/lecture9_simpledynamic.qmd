## Dynamic Models {.scrollable}

Example of a time varying (dynamic) model

Modeling disease through time

[source](http://www.econometricsbysimulation.com/2013/05/sir-model-flue-season-dynamic.html)

![](img/disease_time.png)

## Spatial models that interact - similar to dynamic {.scrollable}

-   Key idea is dependency from one point in time/space to the next!

-   This implies a differential/difference equation to describe the process/transfer function

**Spatially distributed** - model is applied to different “patches” in space

-   spatial units are independent

## Spatial models that interact - similar to dynamic {.scrollable}

## Dynamic modeling {.scrollable}

Dynamic modeling is common in environmental problems solving

-   Similar issues: what happens at one place, depends on neighbors;
-   what happens at one time; depends on previous time -

Space - two way; Time is usually one-way

Dynamic system modeling - quickly becomes complex (Engineering degrees spend a lot of time on this; there are books, entire journals etc on this topic)

## Why you should care {.scrollable}

Many environmental problems and questions can be related to

-   Diffusion
-   Population

Both often require dynamics models; and both often require thinking about dynamics in space and in time

## Vocab {.scrollable}

Some useful terminology

-   **stocks** - variables that evolve over time
-   **flows** - transfers between variables or from the system
-   **parameters** - values that controls the relationship between stocks and flows
-   **sink** - something that absorbs flows
-   **source** - something that generates flows

## More terminology {.scrollable}

-   **System state**: value of all variables need to describe the "entity that evolves through time" at a particular point in time
    -   usually think of these as stores (soil moisture, bank account balance, number of individuals in a particular age class)
-   **State-space**: description of the entity may require multiple variables - for a watershed this could be soil moisture, water currently in dam and water stored in trees, and for each "grid" in a watershed)
-   **State-space trajectories**: how the system state evolves through time
-   **Initial conditions**: values to describe the system state at the beginning

## Examples - note the feedback loops (time dependency) {.scrollable}

![](img/simplerabbit.jpg)

## Human engineering example {.scrollable}

![](img/engineerexample.jpg) \## Feekback is a key feature of dynamic models {.scrollable}

-   dynamic systems often have *feedbak* loops
    -   positive
    -   negative
-   feedbacks often lead to non-linear responses
    -   think "runaway" growth

## Discrete vs Continuous models {.scrollable}

-   do we break time/space in to "chunks" *discrete*

-   or think of time/space as a stream. *continuous*

**Discrete** might be modeling something that occurs once every period; water withdrawls, tax revenues

**Continuous** would be things like pollution, water that are always changing in time

Discrete models for dynamic processes use *difference* equations Continuous models for dynamic processes use *differential* equations

Often it depends on how you look at the system -

## Dynamic System {.scrollable}

Initial conditions

-   to model how something evolves over space and time
    -   you need to know where it starts from

    -   setting initial conditions is usually part of dynamic modellinng

Boundary Value Problems

-   especially for spatial dynamic models sometimes initial conditions are provided values at "end points"

## Stability {.scrollable}

Dynamic systems may lead to *unstable* or *stable* or *cyclic* states over time

-   **stable**...output converges to a particular over time, or for *cyclic* a repeated patterns of values

-   **unstable** ...grows to infinity

-   *chaotic* ..highly sensitive to initial conditions

-   for the same dynamic systems whether you are stable can change with parameters and initial conditions

## Partner Exercize

Discuss examples of dynamic systems \* spatial interaction \* temporal interaction \* both

-   Positive feedback
-   Negative feedback

Think of a model where you might have a multi-dimensional system state

-   what variables would define the state-space

-   what would control the evolution of the state-space

-   what would be the initial conditions

## Simple Example {.scrollable}

Exponential Growth - Simple Dynamic System

-   rate of growth(change) = r \* population(density)
-   differential equation
-   $dP$ / $dt$ = $rP$

## Exponential Growth - Simple Dynamic System {.scrollable}

-   differential equation

$dP$ / $dt$ = $rP$

-   an analytic solution exists so we can write Population as a function of time by integrating both sides

-   $P = PO * exp(rt)$

This is a regular input-output function - that gives population after some time t

## Simple Implementation {.scrollable}

```{r exppop1, echo=TRUE}
source(here("R/exppop.R"))
exppop

# lets look at how this models population over time
years <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)
Ptime <- years %>% map_dbl(~ exppop(P0 = 20, r = 0.01, T = .x))

                           # keep track of what times we ran
Ptime <- data.frame(P = Ptime, years = years)
# plot
ggplot(Ptime, aes(years, P)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "years", y = "Rabbit Population")
```

## Integration, or Solving Differential Equations {.scrollable}

-We want the value of the dependent variation (population) over a range of values for independent variable (time)

-   We know how dependent variable is changing (that's the differential equation)

$dP / dt = rP$

-   For each P we can approximate the next P after a small time period

-   $P_{t+1} = P + dP / dt *  Timestep$

-   But as P changes $dP /dt$ changes so we have to keep time step small (really small if possible)

## Implementing Dynamic Models in R {.scrollable}

Dynamic models always involves derivatives (equations that express how things change from time step to time step or place to place )

Implement population growth as a derivative - a model of population change

```{r derivaties, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# note that we include time here but we don't use it; we will need this later
source(here("R/dexppop.R"))

dexppop
# see how it works
dexppop(P = 20, r = 0.01)


# what is this?

# notices this is the same as
dexppop(t = 100, P = 20, r = 0.01)

# lets look at this for a range of initial populations
pops <- seq(from = 1, to = 100)
tmp <- pops %>% map(~ dexppop(time = 0, r = 0.01, P = .x))
pchange <- unlist(tmp)
```

## plotting the derivative (rate of change) {.scrollable}

```{r, plotderivatives, echo=TRUE}
pdyn <- data.frame(pops, pchange)
ggplot(pdyn, aes(pops, pchange)) +
  geom_point(col = "green", size = 1.5)
```

-   why is this a straight line?
-   how many new individuals are born at each population level

try this - add a carrying capacity (dP/dt = 0 if P \> carryingcapacity) \`

## Integration {.scrollable}

What if we wanted to look at population in 20 years given an initial condition

Two options - First (and easiest)

-   explicit solution to differential equation is known; e.g. you can integrate both sides of the equation! Not always possible but lets look at a case where it is possible
-   you can get the answer exactly and quickly this way

## Explicit Solution is available {.scrollable}

Even with carrying capacity there is an analytical solution, depending on how you think about carrying capacity

-   if you think of carrying capacity as a *hard* limit on the population growth rate, then you can still use the same equation, and just add a limit

```{r explicit}
source(here("R/exppopK.R"))

exppopK

# gives population after any time given an initial population

# 20 rabbits, growth rate of 0.01 how many in 30 years
exppopK(T = 30, P0 = 20, r = 0.01, K = 1000)

# if we want to see how population evolves over time - generate a time series by running our model for each point in time

initialrabbits <- 20
years <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)
Ptime <- years %>% map_dbl(~ exppopK(P0 = initialrabbits, r = 0.01, K = 1000, T = .x))

# keep track of what times we ran
Ptime <- data.frame(P = Ptime, years = years)

ggplot(Ptime, aes(years, P)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "years", y = "Rabbit Population")

# try generating results for maximum and minimum possible r values to compare (guess at what you think)


max_r <- 0.1
min_r <- 0.01
K <- 1000

tmp <- years %>% map_dbl(~ exppopK(r = max_r, P0 = initialrabbits, K = K, T = .x))
Ptime$Pmaxr <- tmp
tmp <- years %>% map_dbl(~ exppopK(r = min_r, P0 = initialrabbits, K = K, T = .x))
Ptime$Pminr <- tmp

head(Ptime)
Ptimep <- Ptime %>% gather(key = "r", value = "P", -years)
ggplot(Ptimep, aes(years, P, col = r)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "years", y = "Rabbit Population")

# notice how population becomes unstable for high growth rates!
```

## Integration {.scrollable}

What if we wanted to look at population in 20 years given an initial condition

Two options

-   explicit solution to differential equation is known; e.g. you can integrate both sides of the equation! Not always possible but lets look at a case where it is possible

-   must be solved by iteration; this is what we do when we can't integrate both sides

What if no analytical solutions is available

# Example {.scrollable}

Continue looking at our rabbit population but we can't solve it..

-   iterate through time

-   calculate rate of change at initial conditions (e.g value of differential equation for initial conditions)

-   add that value to initial conditions, to create state at time t + 1

-   re-calculate rate of change (e.g value of differential equation for state at time t+1)

-   keep doing this

Key questions is how much of a "jump" in t do we do

If you do this you are "kind of" turning the differential equation into a difference equation

## Solving by thinking of problem as a difference equations {.scrollable}

Population models can be discrete (rather than continuous)

So we could implement them as difference equations and iterate

```{r iterate1}
source(here("R/discrete_logistic_popK.R"))
# notice how a for loop is used to iterate

# how many rabbits after 50 years given a growth of 0.1
# starting with 1 rabbit - but a carrying capcity of 500

discrete_logistic_pop

discrete_logistic_pop(P0 = 1, r = 0.05, K = 200, T = 50)

# save results
discrete_result <- discrete_logistic_pop(P0 = 1, r = 0.05, K = 200, T = 50)

# lets also keep the parameters for use later
P0 <- 1
r <- 0.05
K <- 200
T <- 50
```

## Compare discrete and analytic results {.scrollable}

Save the results from both to compare

```{r closed}
source(here("R/exppop.R"))

exppopK(P0 = P0, r = r, K = K, T = T)
analytic_result <- exppopK(P0 = P0, r = r, K = K, T = T)

analytic_result
discrete_result

# why are they different
# look at trajectories

growth_result <- data.frame(time = seq(from = 1, to = 100))

growth_result$Panalytic <- growth_result$time %>% map_dbl(~ exppopK(P0 = 1, r = 0.05, K = 200, T = .x))

growth_result$Pdiscrete <- growth_result$time %>% map_dbl(~ discrete_logistic_pop(P0 = 1, r = 0.05, K = 200, T = .x))
```

## Graph

```{r, graph2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

tmp <- growth_result %>% gather(key = "Ptype", value = "P", -time)
ggplot(tmp, aes(time, P, col = Ptype)) +
  geom_point()

# try running them for longer time periods to see what happens
# change the value of r, K , P0 - see how it effects the results

```

## Solving using numeric integration {.scrollable}

Using a solver....when you can't do the integration by hand :)

Solvers integrate by iteration but doing so in a way that more closely *approximates* analytic integration

Use mathematical tricks to deal with the fact that the rate of change keeps changing :)

There are different types of *solvers*, some work better than others depending on the form of the derivative

## Numerical integration with ODE {.scrollable}

Implement the differential equation as a function that

-   returns the derivative (as a list)

-   inputs time, the variable(s) and a parameter list

(it needs time even though you don’t use it)

My convention: name derivative functions starting with *d* to remind myself that they are computing a derivative

## ODE

Only works for Ordinary Differential Equations - single independent variable (in our case time)

Partial differential equations - more than 1 independent variable (e.g x and y if changing in space)

R has a solver called *ODE* for solving ordinary differential equations from package **desolve**

## *ODE* requires {.scrollable}

-   initial conditions
-   values of independent where we want values of dependent variable (e.g times where we want population)
-   the derivative as a function
-   a list that contains all parameter values (or if you have only one parameter then you can use a single value)

## ODE example {.scrollable}

```{r usingode}
source(here("R/dexppop.R"))

dexppop
library(deSolve)
initialrabbits <- 20
years <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)

# run the solver
Ptime <- ode(y = initialrabbits, times = years, func = dexppop, parms = c(0.01))
head(Ptime)
colnames(Ptime) <- c("year", "P")

# notice that there are additional pieces of information year, including the method used for integration
attributes(Ptime)

# this also means you need to extract just the data frame for plotting
ggplot(as.data.frame(Ptime), aes(year, P)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Population", "years")

# this also works (of course function can be by order)
Ptime <- ode(initialrabbits, years, dexppop, 0.03)
colnames(Ptime) <- c("year", "P")
ggplot(as.data.frame(Ptime), aes(year, P)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Population", "years")
```

## *Homework* {.scrollable}

Try to modify *dexppop* so that it includes carrying capacity and compare with what we did for our analytic and then discrete ways of doing this
