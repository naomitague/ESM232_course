# Building models with blocks


## Example of a loosely coupled model

Generating profit from power generation

Will allow us to compare profits from solar and reservoir power generation

Recall diagram of our model

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
include_graphics(here("lectures_qmd/img/power_comparison_figure.jpeg" ))
```

## Our submodels {.scrollable}

* Power generation from solar radiation (solarpv.R)
* Power generation from reservoir height and flow rate (power_gen.R))
* Profit from power generation (compute_profit_frompower.R)
  (net present value)   (compute_NPV.R)
  
Whats nice about boxes
  * can re-use them
  * can swap them out
  * different team members can work on different boxes

## Putting it all together {.scrollable}

Full picture of power options

-   run *compute_profit_frompower* for both hydro and solar power
    - (loosely coupled models)

-   include informal parameter uncertainty analysis

Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as *compute_profit_frompower* for both sources of power (such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete picture

## Why?

-   Allows us to compare scenarios, accounting for parameter uncertainty

-   Illustrates a general workflow

    -   design your model - reusing where possible
    -   accounting for parameter uncertainty
    -   graphing to analyze results

## First Power Model {.scrollable}

Lets generate some example output for our reservoir model

In "real" application we'd have flow and height measurement here we will generate by sampling (think of it as test data)

* we have measurements that tell us heights normally distributed with mean 10m and standard deviation 0.1m

* we have measurements that tell us flow rates uniformly distributed between 0.1 and 0.3 m3/s

* reserovir efficiency varies uniformly from 0.4 to 0.7

## Code {.scrollable}

-   generate sample inputs for each year
    -   corresponding to years that we have power for the solar model
-   generate uncertainty in efficiency
-   run power model for those inputs and parameter uncertainty
-   compute profit from power

(do some data reorganization as we go to make it easier to graph)

```{r powerres, echo=TRUE}
# repeating what we did before
# lets start with hydro power
source(here("R/power_gen.R"))

# Step 1 - create some sample data for our reservoir model

# we are 'making up' inputs for hydro power - to have it match the number of year
# that we had solar values for, lets sets the number of runs equal to the number of years

number_years <- length(profit_solar$year)

reservoir_model_res <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = number_years, ncol = 3))

colnames(reservoir_model_res) <- c("height", "flow", "power")

# Step 2 - generate heights and flow rates
reservoir_model_res$height <- rnorm(mean = 15, sd = 3.5, n = number_years)

reservoir_model_res$flow <- runif(min = 0.001, max = 0.3, n = number_years)

# Step 3 - generate uncertainty due to reservoir efficiency, lets assume that
# we know its somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7
Keff <- runif(min = 0.5, max = 0.7, n = 20)

# Step 3 - apply model to get power for each height, flow rate (each year), across
# uncertainty in efficiency
reservoir <- Keff %>% map_dfc(~ power_gen(
  height = reservoir_model_res$height,
  flow = reservoir_model_res$flow, Keff = .x
))

colnames(reservoir) <- Keff

head(reservoir)


# add years - remember we are making up data for the same years that we have solar
reservoir$year <- profit_solar$year

# reorganize for easier analysis
reservoirg <- as.data.frame(reservoir) %>% pivot_longer(!year, names_to = "Keff", values_to = "power")
head(reservoirg)
```

# Now like we did for solar....

```{r powerprofit, echo=TRUE}

source(here("R/compute_NPV.R"))
source(here("R/compute_profit_frompower.R"))

best_guess_price <- 0.3  # $/kWh
best_guess_discount <- 0.04  # 4%

compute_profit_frompower


# create profit from hydro
profit_hydro <- compute_profit_frompower(energy = reservoirg$power, year = reservoirg$year, price = best_guess_price, discount =best_guess_discount)
compute_NPV

names(profit_hydro)
```

## Plot

```{r powerresp, echo=TRUE}
# plot
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Net Present Value of Power in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year")


```

## Compare Profit from hydro/reservoir with solar {.scrollable}


```{r quicksum}

mean(profit_hydro$netpre)
mean(profit_solar$netpre)

```

Hydro wins? Right?

# Comparison taking into account uncertainty

```{r power2, echo=TRUE}

a <- ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Hydro", y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year")
b <- ggplot(profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Solar", y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year")
ggarrange(a, b)

# put on one graph
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year", title = "Both") +
  geom_boxplot(data = profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group = year), fill = "orange")

# or do get a nice legend
profit_hydro$etype <- "Hydro"
profit_solar$etype <- "Solar"
tmp <- rbind.data.frame(profit_hydro, profit_solar)
ggplot(tmp, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, fill = etype)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year", fill = "Power Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "orange"))
```

## How might we quantify uncertainty

-   look at spread of net present values 

## What we discovered

While hydro profits are higher - they are more uncertain

What would you chose?

What would a manager chose?


Note - we considered uncertainty in just a few parameters
Would accounting for uncertainty in price change our analysis? How?

If we wanted to reduce uncertainty in hydro profits - what measurements would we make?
(or what parameter might we focus on?) How would we figure that out?
(something to think about)

# Summary {.scrollable}

-   we built a multi component model to compare profit from two different power sources

-   we re-used functions to build out our model

-   we included parameter uncertainty analysis to see how that impacted our profit estimates

- we saw how data organization is an important part of informal sensitivity analysis to make it easier to graph and analyze results
