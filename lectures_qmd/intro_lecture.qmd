# Elements of learning to model

# What is a model?

lets start with conceptualization....

The world is complex - models simplify it...so

"All models are wrong, but some are useful" **George Box - British Statistician**

Thoughts?

# Why Model?

Models give us a way to look at the world through a mixture of data and theory.

A good model can help us to understand how the world works and how decisions that we make might change the world in ways that are important to us.

Useful when there is something you need to **know** in order to solve the problem

# Why Model?

Answer to a question

-   What if?
-   How Much?
-   Which Alternative?
-   Why is this happening?

Test a Hypothesis

# Models are always simplifications

[Simple Box](images/image2-01.png)

Globe: Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage

$P = ET + ΔS$

Watershed: Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage + Streamflow

$P = ET + ΔS + Q$

You are using models all the time - you just don't know it!

## Key challenge: what simplification is useful? {.scrollable}

Beyond a simple model:\
**What controls how much water is in this stream?**

# Model Goals

Because models are only approximations of reality - the most important part of the modelling process is knowing **why** you want to build a model

# Model Goals

Some broad types of goals

-   *Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

-   *Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment, what might the environment look like if something changes)

-   *Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding

Actual goal(s) needs to be more precisely defined

# Models for understanding

What are "big" \#'s, "little" \#'s as controls on phenomena

The is often the role of *inverse inference* models - for example using a GCM to assess whether CO2 emissions can explain trends in warming temperature

This application of models is often in the form of a question

# Example of Model for Understanding

In a particular place (Baltimore Harbor),

Would temperature often be a limiting factor in eutrophication?

At what times of year, would N-export matter?

# Models can also be for communication

Goal: Help public understand why, even if temperature warms - glaciers might grow (due to increasing snowfall) - but a threshold temperature might be reached where glacier will shrink

# Model Goals

*Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

*Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment)

*Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding
