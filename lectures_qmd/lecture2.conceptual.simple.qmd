# Model Goals

-   understanding

-   prediction

-   communication

You are doing this all the time - there are many reasons to make this process explicit (computer aided modeling)

Inverse inference problem in the context of the environment

Pair-Share

# Conceptual Models

-   models are **always** simplifications of reality - they help us to make sense of reality by focusing on specific aspects that are most relevant to your goal

-   always start a modeling project by diagramming your conceptual model - how do you see the system;

-   from here you design or choose your 'actual' model

-   in a project, it is critical to dialogue to agree on the conceptual model

# Getting to a good conceptual model

-   Know what the goal is of your modeling project - precisely

-   Use that to decide what to include/exclude

-   Define inputs and outputs

# Some definitions

**Inputs** : Varying; think *x* of a *x* vs. *y* regression

**Parameters** : single values that influence relationships in the model

**Outputs** : what you want to estimate

# Simple model

**Input** : Change in unemployment rate

**Output** : Change in GDP

**Parameters** : Slope and intercept of the line

The US "changes in unemployment -- GDP growth" regression with the 95% confidence bands.

# Goals

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: **Outputs**

*Problem*: how will forest carbon sequestration change if fire frequency increases with warming

-   What might be the outputs of a model?
-   What might be the assumptions

# Example1

*Outputs*: carbon sequestration for different fire frequencies

*Assumptions*..stand-age versus carbon trajectories won't change with warming

# Goals - Example 2

*Problem*: which piece of land should be purchased to maximize biodiversity?

# Goals - Example 2

*Outputs*: monetary costs and benefits of different options in 2015 dollars, including "non-market" benefits

Assumptions: non-market benefits are reflected by ..

# Conceptual Models

This is the **MOST** important step

-   Models are simplifications of reality

-   What processes in complex reality are your going to consider? why?

-   What is in the "box" that translates inputs to outputs?

**Good questions for statistical and machine learning models - why?**

# Things to think about

-   Inverse Inference - what mechanisms, parameters, inputs leads to the response you are observing (understanding)

-   What processes do you expect to be significantly influence outcome you are interested in (prediction)

-   How do you "show" what influences an observation/prediction (communication)

# Inverse Inference Example {.scrollable}

1. A city health department observe asthma hospitalization rates in a specific neighborhood hospital are twice as high as average rates in that state

2. An amphibian (salamander or newt) population has declined in the Santa Monica Mountains

**Pick one** - Quickly summarize what comes to your mind as the in inverse inference (conceptual) model that leads to this finding.

# Whats in the box

Often more complicated than a simple single equation - such as a multiple regression equation

\
\begin{aligned}
Pop_{\text{newt}} =\;& \beta_0 \\
&+ \beta_1\,\text{Precipitation} \\
&+ \beta_2\,\text{Temperature} \\
&+ \beta_3\,\text{PredatorPresence} \\
&+ \beta_4\,\text{RoadDensity} \\
&+ \beta_5\,\text{Pollution}
\end{aligned}
\

## Relationships and Processes 
* Can be even more complex - what is connected with what and when

* What are some time-space relationships we might have to think about?

## Some possible extensions to conceptual model {.scrollable}


Relationship between the timing of precipitation and newt lifecycle. 

If there is a particular pollution source -  prevailing wind patterns and how long particles stay in the air

\
\begin{aligned}
Pop_{\text{newt}} =\;& \beta_0 \\
&+ \beta_1\,\text{Precipitation} \\
&+ \beta_2\,\text{Temperature} \\
&+ \beta_3\,\text{PredatorPresence} \\
&+ \beta_4\,\text{RoadDensity} \\
&+ \beta_5\,\text{Pollution}
\end{aligned}
\

+ pollution at time lag t-1 weighted by wind direction and speed
(model of pollution transport)

+ $\beta_5$ vulnerability to pollution varies with newt life stage (eggs more vulnerable than adults)

+ population age structure (Pop_newt_eggs, Pop_newt_juvenile, Pop_newt_adult) - all varying through time




# Composing Diagrams

Pictorial representation your model and what needs to be included in the model to answer your questions (or achieve your modelling goal)

There are many software tools available for generating conceptual models, I like

[Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)

# Example of a hydrology model (conceptual diagram)

*PhD of Norman Crawford under supervision of Ray K Linsley at Stanford University in 1962*

# Example of a model to classify harzard risk

![](img/cmclassify.png)

# Example more complex model - Fire Regime Model

-   More complex model couple sub-models ( may be a loose coupling where users connects submodels)

-   How do ecological and human factors interact to influence fire regimes

## Conceptual Models: Things to think about {.scrollable}

-   What inputs/parameters will influence how a process/mechanism leads to the outputs you are interested in

-   Can you measure those inputs/parameters? If not is there a proxy? Or another model?

-   Are there features of the environment that influence the relationship between input/parameter and output?

-   Are there inputs/parameters that you want to vary across cenarios (things you'd want to 'change')

-   Time and Space (are you looking at a short or long terms behavior? do you care about spatial patterns? at what scale?)

-   What are some key assumptions?

# Develop a Conceptual Model

-   Form groups of 3
-   With your group, come up with a modeling goal
-   Decide if the goal is understanding,prediction or communication
-   Brainstorm on important
    -   inputs, parameters and outputs
    -   relationships/processes
    -   assumptions

# Types of Model

There are many different ways to classify models

A *useful* classification looks at how models deal with space, time, and process

Useful because the *type* of model will have implications for how you *build* and *use/run* the model

## Stochastic - Deterministic

**Stochastic**: Model output is the probability of flood events of a magnitude greater than 500 m3/sec given rainfall probability distribution (artificial or generated from data) for a 100km2 watershed

**Deterministic**: Model output is the depth of flood given a rainfall event of 10cm over a 100km2 watershed

## Stochastic - Deterministic

# Lumped …Spatially distributed

**Lumped** - single point in space, or space doesn’t matter

**Spatially distributed** - model is applied to different “patches” in space

  * spatial units are independent
  * spatial units interact with each other

![](img/spatial.001.png)

# Climate models are good examples of spatially distributed models

[source](http://eo.ucar.edu/staff/rrussell/climate/modeling/climate_model_resolution.html)

![](img/gcm_spatial.jpeg)

Resolution matters for spatial models

# Static- Dynamic Time Varying

Static - Processes or Variables modeled do not evolve with time

Dynamic - model elements evolve through time - variables/results at one time step typically depends on previous time step

![](img/temporal.001.png)

# Example of a time varying (dynamic) model

Modeling disease through time

# Abstract - Physically/Process based

**Abstract** - relationship between inputs and output depends on parameters that don’t necessarily have a physical meaning - **machine learning models** are good examples

**Physically based** - parameters do have a physical meaning (could be measured) - relationships derived from first principles (theory) of how things work

# Physically based can be "approximate"

Think...simple bucket model

![](img/bucket.jpeg)

# Why the type of models matters

-   assumptions
-   implementation
-   output
    -   format
    -   analysis
    -   visualization
