## Comparing Model with Observations

Why?

-   to make a "case" for why you selected this model for your project
-   to quantify uncertainty in your model outputs
-   to choose parameters that make the model perform well
    -   reduce parameter uncertainty

## Quantifying Model Performance {.scrollable}

-   Depends on type of model output

    -   single value (mean energy production from a solar panel)
    -   time series (streamflow, PM10, monthly energy production )
    -   spatial pattern (population, income level)
    -   space-time (pollution in different cites over time, forest biomass growth across different forests)

-   Depends on observations

## Qantifying Model Performance {.scrollable}

-   Depends on type of model output

    -   single value (mean energy production from a solar panel)
    -   time series (streamflow, PM10, monthly energy production )
    -   spatial pattern (population, income level)
    -   space-time (pollution in different cites over time, forest biomass growth across different forests)

-   Depends on observations

    -   often not as "dense" as model output (e.g samples)
    -   sometimes you have a time series (e.g. streamflow, PM10)
    -   sometimes you have a spatial pattern (e.g. population, income level)
    -   often you are sampling (e.g mean PM10, mean streamflow) so there is also error/uncertainty in the observation

## Metrics

-   what is possible given available data
-   what is important to get "right" given model application

## Example (Picking model based on performance)

![Model Comparison](img/hydrometric.png)


[Staudinger, M., Stahl, K., Seibert, J., Clark, M. P., and Tallaksen, L. M.: Comparison of hydrological model structures based on recession and low flow simulations, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., 8, 6833-6866, doi:10.5194/hessd-8-6833-2011, 2011]{style="font-size:50%"}

## Somme classic metrics {.scrollable}

-   t.test (are the means different)
-   var.test (are the variances different)

Dynamic models (trends over space and time)

-   RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
-   Correlation ($R^2$)
-   NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) (variance weighted correlation)

But you can code your own

-   make them an R function for utility

## NSE

$NSE = \frac{\sum((m_i - o_i)^2)}{\sum((o_i - mean(o))^2}$

``` r
nse = function(m, o) {
  err = m - o
  meanobs = mean(o)
  mse = sum(err^2)
  ovar = sum((o - meanobs)^2)
  return(1 - mse / ovar)
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Percent Error

Useful to see if over whole time series you have a bias

Relative Error (%) = $\frac{\bar{m} - \bar{o}}{\bar{o}} \times 100$

``` r
relerr = function(m, o) {
  err = m - o
  meanobs = mean(o)
  return(mean(err) / meanobs)
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Soft Metrics: Fuzzy Evaluation


-   Handle uncertainty/imprecise/quantitative data
-   Fuzzy membership functions

Many options - here's one example

$perf(x) = \begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if } x \leq a_1 \\
   \frac{x - a_1}{a_2 - a_1} & \text{if } a_1 \leq x < a_2 \\
  1 & \text{if } a_2 \leq x < a_3 \\
  \frac{a_4 - x}{a_4 - a_3} & \text{if } a_3 \leq x < a_4 \\
   0 & \text{if } x \geq a_4
\end{cases}$

[Seibert, J., and J. J. McDonnell, On the dialog between experimentalist and modeler in catchment hydrology: Use of soft data for multicriteria model calibration, Water Resour. Res., 38(11), 1241, doi:10.1029/2001WR000978, 2002]{style="font-size:50%"}


# Example application {.scrollable}

For a given year, we just know whether the water manager reported a drought

For our watershed


-   if streamflow was less than 800 mm/year then for sure it was a drought
-   if streamflow was between 800 and 1000 mm/year then it was a drought with some uncertainty
-   if streamflow is above 1000 mm/year then it was not a drought

But all we know is the report for each year

Can we evaluate our model performance given this uncertainty?

Two Conditions 
*  drought  a1=0, a2=0, a3=800, a4=1000 
* OK  upper bound just pick really large numbers 
  * a1=800, a2=1000, a3=10000, a4=10000

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
source(here("R/fuzzy_perf.R"))
w8_wy = readRDS(here("Data/w8_wy.RDS"))

# first year 
w8_wy[1,"report"]
fuzzy_perf(w8_wy$model[1], 800, 1000, 10000, 10000)
w8_wy[1,"report"]
fuzzy_perf(w8_wy$model[3], 0, 0, 800, 1000)

w8_wy$perf = 0
for (i in 1:nrow(w8_wy)) {
  w8_wy$perf[i] = ifelse(w8_wy$report[i] == "drought",
    fuzzy_perf(w8_wy$model[i], 0, 0, 800, 1000),
    fuzzy_perf(w8_wy$model[i], 800, 1000, 10000, 10000))
}



```


## Combining Metrics

-   Normalize metrics (0-1)
-   Make all increase with performance
-   Weighted sum or multiplicative approach

$Metric_A * Metric_B * Metric_C$

$Metric_A * weight_A + Metric_B * weight_B + Metric_C * weight_C$ where $weight_A + weight_B + weight_C = 1$

## Normalizing

SSE = $1/n*\sum((m_i - o_i)^2)$

How do I make this 0-1? and increasing values give better performance

## solution options

$L = (SSE)^{-n}$

$L = exp(-n * SSE)$

$L = (max(SSE) - SSE) / max(SSE)$

where $max(SSE)$ is the maximum value of SSE across all models or sometimes

$L = (SSE - min(SSE)) / (max(SSE) - min(SSE))$


## Combined Performance

Example R function

Lets go back to daily streamflow data

```{r, echo=TRUE}

source(here("R/nse.R"))
source(here("R/relerr.R"))
source(here("R/cper.R"))

w8 = readRDS(here("Data/w8.RDS"))


```
