## STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in ES {.scrollable}

Clearly define your goal (a question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

-   Design or Select your model

-   Implement the model

-   Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

-   Apply the model to the goal

-   Communicate model results

## Steps: Design and Implement your model {.scrollable}

-   Diagram your model

-   Translate diagram into a mathematical representation

-   Choose programming language

-   Define inputs (data type, units)

-   Define output (data type, units)

-   Define model structure

-   Write model

-   Document the model (meta data)

-   Test model

## Building Models {.scrollable}

Modularity! (Functions)

The basic building blocks of models


Functions are the “boxes” of the model 

  - the transfer function that takes inputs and returns outputs
  - most languages have a function library (e.g. R, Python, C++)

More complex models 

- made up of multiple functions; 
- boxes with arrows
- *main* function that calls other functions, flow control
- nested functions (functions that other functions and control the flow 


# For each box/function 

Decide on

-   Inputs and parameters

-   Outputs

Data types, units (time and space aggregation), names should be (use descriptive names)

**IMPORTANT**

Place each function in its own file (x.R), and put all functions for a given project in *R* subdirectory

# What’s in the box

Often more complicated than a simple single equation (regression results)

So we need to think through steps are - what is connected with what

Diagrams are a good place to start

# Modularity - Discrete Tasks

-   Hierarchical in level of details

-   Big chunks (coarse detail) -\> progressively finer

-   Note ‘tasks’ that need to be repeated

-   All tasks should have inputs and outputs

# Model design flowcharts

Some model designers uses standard symbols for the different model components

## Solar Photovoltaic Model {.scrollable}

**Design** - function that estimates solar pv power given inputs of radiation

**Model inputs**: solar radiation (daily direct and diffuse)

**Model outputs**: power generated each year and average power over time

**Parameters**: panel efficiency, system performance, units, type of array (uses diffuse or not), plot Y/N

Some of these options such as whether to plot determine outputs from the function

AND the type of array to determine whether it uses diffuse radiation, these parameters change how the function/model works

# Solar function example as code

Model Code

You need *tidyverse*, *here* libraries to run.  



```{r solar, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

source(here("R/solarpv.R"))
solarpv
```

## Some Data {.scrollable}

We will plot to check that the input data makes sense

- look at data 
- plot radiation by month

```{r datacheck}

library(tidyverse)
# read in R formatted data
load(here("Data/sierraczosolar.rda"))

# already in the format required for the model
head(sierraczosolar)

```
## Plot {.scrollable}

```{r datacheck2, echo=TRUE}
# plot
# lets make months names rather than labels

sierraczosolar$month <- factor(sierraczosolar$month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb)

# now plot
ggplot(sierraczosolar, aes(x = month, y = (Kdown_direct+Kdown_diffuse), fill=month)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Solar Radiation (W/m2)") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Run the model with this data {.scrollable}

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# run the model
solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, 
        clr = "green", eunit = "W", g=FALSE)

# run and save results - but don't plot
site1 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, 
            clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE)
site1$mean
site1$annual
```

# On your own

- read through function code
- run the model with the data
- change parameter and re-run
- turn graphing on

# Visual Checking

-   what issue jumps out - what might be the cause?
-   how would you fix this?

```{r}
# remove the first year from the dataset
sierraczosolar <- sierraczosolar %>%
  filter(year > 1944)

# now run the model again
site1 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, 
          solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = TRUE)

```

 Try changing an input and see what you get!

# Playing with models

We often build models to try different options

**Model inputs**: solar radiation (daily direct and diffuse)

**Model outputs**: power generated each year and average power over time

**Parameters**: panel efficiency, system performance, units, type of array (uses diffuse or not), plot Y/N

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# consider a different PV array that only uses
# diffuse and has non standard efficiency (0.6)
site2 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, 
        solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", 
        eunit = "W", g = FALSE, eff = 0.6, etype = "direct")
site2$mean
```

# Informal Sensitivity Analysis {.scrollable}

What happens when we vary parameters?

**Informal** - just try varying parameters

-   decide which parameter(s) and what range to vary the parameter over - what is the uncertainty? (+- 15% )?

-   figure out how to efficiently run your model over parameter variation and save results as you go

-   analyze the sensitivity (simply plotting for now)

## Helpful tools {.scrollable}

-   Sampling

    - *runif*, 
    - *rnorm* (sampling from uniform and normal distributions) 
    - *seq* (for creating a sequence of numbers)

-   Repeating

    -   in R - *purrr* package, also *apply* family of function
    -   classic *for* loops

If you need it a good source to review working with *purrr* to extract items from list and repeat operations

[Useful Purrr Resource](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-19_purrr/)


# Example

- we will start by using **map** 
- which "maps* a function (runs it ) for a list of values, 
- we can also use these function to extract values from a list

# R code for informal sensitivity

We are not sure what the efficiency of the PV array is

How important is this parameter to the results?


How we do this depends on what we know about efficiency

- manufacturer reports mean and standard deviation*
- manufacturer provides a range   

Mean 0.6 standard deviation of 0.1

# R code 
```{r sen1, eval=T, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

# first come up with varying values for efficiency 
# if we don't know efficiency exactly , lets try 20 samples


eff <- rnorm(mean = 0.6, sd = 0.1, n = 20)

# use map from purrr to run model for all values of eff
# notice how map adds the one parameter that is missing from the input list

site2 <- eff %>% map(~ solarpv(area = 0.1, 
  solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", 
  eunit = "W", g = FALSE, etype = "direct", eff = .x))

head(site2)
```

## Data Structures {.scrollable}


- challenge in sensitivity analysis is often what data structure to use 
- organize parameter variation and result variation

- R often returns lists - but not so easy for organization

- ask yourself what you want to do with the data, then put in a structure that will make this easy

- e.g two different data frames
  - plot variation in mean annual electricity by *eff*
  - plot variation in each year due to variation in   *eff*
  -  a data frame is often the best structure for graphing
 
  

```{r sen1b, eval=T}

head(str(site2))
# this is pretty messy - but we can extract a useful data structure,lets say we want
# just the annual data (not the mean annual time series), and then reformat as a data frame with nice column names
tmp <- map_dfr(site2, `[`, c("annual"))

site2df <- data.frame(year = tmp$annual$year, elect = tmp$annual$elect)
head(site2df)
```


## Looking at results from informal sensitivity analysis {.scrollable}

-   [Box plots or Violin Plots of Model Output (where box shows effect of parameter uncertainty)]{style="color: green;"}

WHY: To see how big the range of output might be relative to "uncertain" parameter range

-   [Plot Response against parameter value]{style="color: green;"}

WHY: To see how the parameter influences the results

-   [Average across parameter uncertainty]{style="color: green;"}

WHY: If you want the one number that is the "best guess" given uncertainty

## Variation in annual electricity due to parameter uncertainty {.scrollable}

* boxplot
* just need all the annual electricity by year


```{r sen2, eval=T, echo=TRUE}


# now we could plot
ggplot(site2df, aes(year, elect, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Electricity generated in W")
```

## Add an average line 

Why?
```{r sen2b, eval=T, echo=TRUE}
# we also might want an average across parameter uncertainty
site2_average <- site2df %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(elect = mean(elect))

# now add this to the plot - note that we remove the grouping by using group=1
ggplot(site2df, aes(year, elect, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Electricity in W") +
  geom_line(data = site2_average, aes(year, elect, group = 1), col = "orange")
```

## How does efficiency impact mean annual electricity estimate  {.scrollable}

- Data structure with *eff* and mean annual electricity
- X-Y plots

Organize the data
```{r sene, eval=T, echo=TRUE}
# we could also plot how the mean annual electricity varies with efficiency (eff from above)
site2[[1]]

tmp <- map_df(site2, `[`, c("mean"))

# how variable is electricity generation (mean over all time) with uncertainty in solar efficiency

site2_mean <- data.frame(eff = eff, elect = tmp)
```

## Plot {.scrollable}

- how variable is the model output given parameter variation
- how does the variation in parameter impact model output

```{r sene2, eval=T, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Electricity in W")

# or to see what the sensitivity looks like
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(eff, mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Electricity in W", x = "Solar Efficiency")

# my best guess
mean(site2_mean$mean)
```

# ASSIGNMENT 2 Almond Yields

Lobell et al., 2006 used data to build models of tree crop yield for California that captured how climate variation (place and time) might influence yield

-   Yield anomaly

-   Climate variables

Assumptions...as you work think about what these are...

# Assignment

For this assignment you will work in *pairs*

Your goal is to implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate

-   Inputs: daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation

-   Outputs: maximum, minimum and mean yield anomoly for a input time series

The Lobell et al. 2006 paper will be the source for the transfer function that you will use in your model; specifically look at the equations in table 2.

## What you will do - Model Set Up {.scrollable}

1.  Draw diagram to represent your model - how it will translate inputs to outputs, with parameters that shape the relationship between inputs an outputs - on your diagram list what your inputs, parameters and outputs are with units

2.  Implement your diagram as an R function

Here are some ideas to think though. The climate data is going to need to be processed (e.g note that the model uses climate data from a particular month - you have ALL of the climate as daily data). Here are two possible model outlines to follow

● Almond_model \<- function(clim_var1, clim_var2, parameters){……}

● Almond_model \<- function(clim, parameters){……}

The first example is where the climate variables are separately input into the function - climate data is processed beforehand as part of model set up

The second is where a climate data frame is the input in the function and you extract the useful data from it as part of the model.

You can pick which option you prefer (or try both)

## Run the model {.scrollable}

3.  Run your model for the **clim.txt** data that is posted on Canvas,

**clim.txt** has the following columns

these 4 columns tell you when climate observations were made

-   *day*
-   *month*
-   *year*
-   *wy* (water year)

the next 3 columns are the climate observations

-   maximum (*tmax_c*) daily temperature
-   minimum (*tmin_c*) daily temperature
-   precipitation (*precip*) on that day in mm

# check your work

I will tell you that

-   the maximum almond yield anomaly should be approximately 1920 ton/acre
-   the lowest almond yield anomaly should be approximately -0.027 ton/acre
-   the mean almond yield anomaly should be approximately 182 ton/acre

# Notes

-   There are always multiple ways to code something in R;

-   Remember that we want to strive for our code being as simple and streamline as possible.

-   Style counts.

    -   Make sure you choose meaningful variable names and add comments.
    -   Include comments at the top of the function to tell the user what the inputs/outputs are and their units and format.

# What to hand in on Canvas

Two separate files (or a link to a repository with these files)

1.  a R file that has your function definition
2.  a Rmarkdown file that includes your conceptual model (embed as picture) and shows how you applied the function to the test climate data (*clim.txt*)

## Grading Rubric  {.scrollable}
