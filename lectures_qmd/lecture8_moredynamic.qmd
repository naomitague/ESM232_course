## Using the ODE solver {.scrollable}

To integrate a differential equation using ODE solver in R requires

\*initial conditions

\*differential equation

\*parameters

## Additional parameters

With the ODE solver we can add additional parameters to the function

-   parameters must all be input as a single list
-   similar to how we return multiple outputs from a function

see example below..lets add a carrying capacity

## R code with carrying capacity {.scrollable}

```{r exampleode}
library(deSolve)


source(here("R/dexppop_play.R"))

dexppop_play

# create parameter list
initalrabbits <- 2
years <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)

newparms <- list(r = 0.03, carry_capacity = 300)

# apply solver
results <- ode(initalrabbits, years, dexppop_play, newparms)
head(results)

# add more meaningful names
colnames(results) <- c("year", "P")
```

## Plot

```{r, plotodep}
# plot
ggplot(as.data.frame(results), aes(year, P)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Population", "years")
```

## Try again with different parameters {.scrollable}

```{r exampleode2}
# same initial condtions
initalrabbits <- 2
years <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)

# try again with different parameters
alternativeparms <- list(r = 0.04, carry_capacity = 500)
results2 <- ode(initalrabbits, years, dexppop_play, alternativeparms)


# look at results
head(results2)
colnames(results2) <- c("year", "P_parm2")

# plot
ggplot(as.data.frame(results2), aes(year, P_parm2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Population", "years")

# compare by combining into a single data frame
both <- inner_join(as.data.frame(results), as.data.frame(results2))

both_p <- both %>% gather(key = "model", value = "P", -year)

```

## Plot

```{r, plotb}
# plot
ggplot(both_p, aes(year, P, col = model)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Population", "years")
```

## Differential Equation, Difference (Iteration by hand) comparison {.scrollable}

Remember we have 3 ways now to calculate population

-   analytical solution - based on integration (exppop.R) BEST

-   using an ode solver for numerical approximation (exppop_play.R)

-   numerical integration using in discrete steps (discrete_logistic_pop.R)

## How do they differ

```{r, compare, echo=TRUE}
# lets also keep the parameters for use later
P0 <- 2
r <- 0.05
K <- 200


# get all models
# discrete
source(here("R/discrete_logistic_popK.R"))
# analytic
source(here("R/exppopK.R"))
# differential for ode
source(here("R/dexppop_play.R"))


# create times we want to see results for
growth_result <- data.frame(time = seq(from = 1, to = 100))

growth_result$Panalytic <- growth_result$time %>% map_dbl(~ exppopK(P0 = P0, r = r, K = K, T = .x))

growth_result$Pdiscrete <- growth_result$time %>% map_dbl(~ discrete_logistic_pop(P0 = P0, r = r, K = K, T = .x))


# set up using the same parameters
pcompare <- list(r = r, carry_capacity = K)
# now run our ODE solver
result <- ode(P0, growth_result$time, dexppop_play, pcompare)
head(result)

# we already have time - so just extract population
growth_result$Pdifferential <- result[, 2]

# compare all 3 approaches
tmp <- growth_result %>% pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = "Ptype", values_to = "P")
ggplot(tmp, aes(time, P, col = Ptype)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Graph

```{r, compareplot2}
ggplot(tmp, aes(time, P, col = Ptype)) +
  geom_point()

# notice Pdifferential is closer to Panalytic than Pdiscrete
```

## Other Examples {.scrollable}

All differential and difference equations are approximations The analytical solution is exact

Notice that differential equations is a bit more accurate!

## Lets look at something a bit more complicated {.scrollable}

-   diffusion (how a contaminent moves through space and time)
-   start with 1 dimension in space

## Diffusion Conceptual model {.scrollable}

## Modeling Diffusion {.scrollable}


Diffusion can be implemented as a partial differential equation

Complicated to solve - but there are tool in R for specific types of partial differential equations [Reactive Transport Example](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ReacTran/index.html)

## Sources for more on diffusion {.scrollable}

## Simple diffusion model {.scrollable}

Diffusion would require partial derivatives - time and space! it gets much more tricky ...beyond this course

Example of Diffusion - difference equation implementation to see what some issues can be

## Diffusion in 1 dimension {.scrollable}

## Diffusion in one dimension through time {.scrollable}

## Diffusion data structure {.scrollable}

## R implementation {.scrollable}

```{r}
source(here("R/diffusion.R"))

# run our diffusion model (iterative difference equation) with initial concentration of 10, for 8 timestep (size 1m), and 10 space steps (size 1s)
# using diffusion parameters 0.5 s/m2, 10 m2
result <- diff1(initialC = 10, nx = 10, dx = 1, nt = 8, dt = 1, D = 0.5, area = 10)

# a list is returned with our 3 data frames for concentration (conc), qin and qout
result

# used filled contour to plot results
head(result$conc)
filled.contour(result$conc, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance")

# or if you prefer this orientation (Distance on x axis)
filled.contour(t(result$conc), ylab = "Time", xlab = "Distance")
```

## Change parameters (diffusivity D, and space and time steps (dx, dt)) {.scrollable}

```{r}
# changes diffusivity and other parameters particularly
# diffusivity, dx and dt
res <- diff1(initialC = 10, nx = 10, dx = 1, nt = 10, dt = 30, D = 0.006, area = 1)

filled.contour(res$conc, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance")


# we can also see how much material moved from place to place each time step
filled.contour(res$qin, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance")


# play with time step, space step and parameters
```

## Play {.scrollable}

Try running the diffusion model with different time steps, space steps and parameters

## Some examples with different parameters and space/time steps {.scrollable}

```{r}
# what if we increase diffusivity
resfast <- diff1(initialC = 10, nx = 10, dx = 0.5, nt = 10, dt = 10, D = 0.08, area = 1)
filled.contour(resfast$conc, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance")


# Discretization Issue Example
resunstable <- diff1(initialC = 10, nx = 10, dx = 1, nt = 10, dt = 10, D = 0.8, area = 1)
filled.contour(resunstable$conc, xlab = "Time (fraction of hour)", ylab = "Distance Along Path (m)", main = "Pollutant Diffusion")

# this illustrates the problem with difference equations (and the challenges that methods for numerical integration try to overcome)
# if things are changing quickly we need to use much smaller time, space steps to avoid overshoot and instability

# so lets cut our step size by 10 (dt) (but then add 10 more steps (nx) to cover the same distance)
resunstable <- diff1(initialC = 10, nx = 100, dx = 1, nt = 10, dt = 1, D = 0.8, area = 1)
filled.contour(resunstable$conc, xlab = "time", ylab = "Distance Along Path")
```

## Dynamics Models {.scrollable}


-   Diffusion example illustrates the challenge of numerical integration

-   We see evidence of "overshoot"

-   Correct by reducing the time step (but then we have to increase the number of time steps to cover the same period)



## Diffusion Example {.scrollable}

```{r}
source(here("R/diffusion.R"))


# Change parameters (diffusivity D, and space and time steps (dx, dt))

res <- diff1(initialC = 100, nx = 10, dx = 1, nt = 10, dt = 30, D = 0.001, area = 1)
filled.contour(res$conc, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Concentration through time and space")


# we can also see how much material is moving in to each cell at each time step
filled.contour(res$qin, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Qin - material coming in ")

# we can also see net amount of material moved from place to place each time step
filled.contour(res$qin - res$qout, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Qin-Qout NET ")

# what if we increase diffusivity
resfast <- diff1(initialC = 100, nx = 10, dx = 0.5, nt = 10, dt = 10, D = 0.08, area = 1)
filled.contour(resfast$conc, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Concentration through time and space")
filled.contour(resfast$qin, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Qin")


# this illustrates the problem with difference equations (and the challenges that methods for numerical integration try to overcome)
# if things are changing quickly we need to use much smaller time, space steps to avoid overshoot and instability

# so lets cut our step size by 10 (dt) (but then  multiply number of steps (nx) to cover the same distance)
resfast_fixtime <- diff1(initialC = 100, nx = 10, dx = 0.5, nt = 100, dt = 1, D = 0.08, area = 1)
filled.contour(resfast_fixtime$conc, xlab = "time", ylab = "Distance Along Path", main = "Concentration through time and space")

filled.contour(resfast_fixtime$qin, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Qin")
filled.contour(resfast_fixtime$qin - resfast_fixtime$qout, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Distance", main = "Net Transport")
```

## Extracting meaning from time series output {.scrollable}

Useful to brainstorm about what is important

For example

-   time it takes to evenly diffuse?

How would we implement that?

## Extracting information from space-time results {.scrollable}

-   pictures can be hard to interpret

-   summarizing over one of the dimensions (either space or time) can help

-   looking at a single trajectory through time

-   looking at spatial variation for one point in time

-   looking at spatial variation for multiple points in time

## Try it {.scrollable}

```{r one option}
# View(resfast_fixtime$conc)


# graph a single point in space through time
# single column (time)
plot(resfast_fixtime$conc[, 3], ylab = "Concentration for a location 2 spatial units from origin (1+2")

# plot all trajectories
# add a time column to concentration data frame and transform for plotting
resl <- as.data.frame(resfast_fixtime$conc) %>%
  mutate(time = seq(from = 1, to = 100)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-time, names_to = "distance", values_to = "conc")
ggplot(resl, aes(time, conc, col = distance)) +
  geom_line()

# plot all places at each point in time
ggplot(resl, aes(time, conc, group = time)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# use apply to calculate the spatial variation for each row (e.g for each time point)
cvar <- resfast_fixtime$conc %>% apply(1, var)
cmean <- resfast_fixtime$conc %>% apply(1, mean)

spatial_aver <- cbind.data.frame(cvar, cmean, time = seq(from = 1, to = 100))
length(cvar)
# notice its the same as the number of time units (nt) used above

# plot spatial variation through time
ggplot(spatial_aver, aes(time, cvar)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Spatial Variation")

# plot coefficient of variation (so standard deviation divided by the mean)
ggplot(spatial_aver, aes(time, 100 * sqrt(cvar) / cmean)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "COV (as percent")
```
