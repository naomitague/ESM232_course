# Building models with blocks 

Functions can always embed other functions - and in models the output of one model may be the input to another

-   loosely coupled models - output from one becomes input the other, but this step is  necessarily automatic 
-   fully coupled - models exchange input and outputs (feedback systems) inside a larger wrapper model (think of it as the *meta* model)

## Example of a loosely coupled model

Generating profit from power generation

Will allow us to compare profits from solar and reservoir power generation

First step: diagram of our model

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
include_graphics(here("lectures_qmd/img/power_comparison_figure.jpeg" ))
```

## Defining our boxes/submodels {.scrollable}

To start - lets create what we need to compute net present value of profit from power generated for multiple years

We can re-use this to compute profit for power from either source

-   compute_profit_frompower.R

The profit function also 'calls' another function to compute net present value

-   compute_NPV

    -   inputs: value, time, discount rate

    -   output net present value of input value provide as some time in the future

-   compute_profit_frompower

    -   inputs: energy, year (energy was produced in) price, discount rate
    -   outputs: single dataframe with columns for
        -   energy
        -   year
        -   net (profit from energy in that year)
        -   netpre (net present value of that profit)



```{r valuep, echo=TRUE}
source(here("R/compute_NPV.R"))
source(here("R/compute_profit_frompower.R"))

compute_profit_frompower

compute_NPV

# use output from our solar model as input to profit
# See previous lecture4_informal_sensitivity.qmd  or informal_sensitivity.qmd
load(here("Data/annual_elect_solar.rda"))
head(solar_annual_elect)

profit_solar <- compute_profit_frompower(
  energy = solar_annual_elect$elect,
  year = solar_annual_elect$year,
  price = 30, discount = 0.04
)

head(profit_solar)

profit_solar <- subset(profit_solar, year > 1944)

ggplot(profit_solar, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Profit in current $", x = "Year")
```

## Putting it all together{.scrollable}

Full picture of power options

-   run *compute_profit_frompower* for both hydro and solar power

-   include sensitivity analysis to account for parameter undertainty in both

Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as *compute_profit_frompower* for both sources of power (such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete picture

## Why?

-   Allows us to compare scenarios, accounting for parameter uncertainty

-   Illustrates a general workflow

    -   design your model - reusing where possible
    -   accounting for parameter uncertainty
    -   graphing to analyze results

## First Power Model {.scrollable}

Lets generate some example output for our reservoir model

In "real" application we'd have flow and heigh measurement
here we will generate by sampling (think of it as test data)

## Code {.scrollable}

- generate sample inputs for each year
    - corresponding to years that we have power for the solar model
- generate uncertainty in efficiency
- run power model for those inputs and parameter uncertainty
- compute profit from power

(do some data reorganization as we go to make it easier to graph)

```{r powerres, echo=TRUE}
# repeating what we did before
# lets start with hydro power
source(here("R/power_gen.R"))

# Step 1 - create some sample data for our reservoir model

# we are 'making up' inputs for hydro power - to have it match the number of year
# that we had solar values for, lets sets the number of runs equal to the number of years

number_years <- length(profit_solar$year)

reservoir_model_res <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = number_years, ncol = 3))

colnames(reservoir_model_res) <- c("height", "flow", "power")

# Step 2 - generate heights and flow rates
reservoir_model_res$height <- rnorm(mean = 10, sd = 1, n = number_years)

reservoir_model_res$flow <- runif(min = 0.1, max = 1, n = number_years)

# Step 3 - generate uncertainty due to reservoir efficiency, lets assume that
# we know its somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7
Keff <- runif(min = 0.4, max = 0.7, n = 20)

# Step 3 - apply model to get power for each height, flow rate (each year), across
# uncertainty in efficiency
reservoir <- Keff %>% map_dfc(~ power_gen(
  height = reservoir_model_res$height,
  flow = reservoir_model_res$flow, Keff = .x
))

colnames(reservoir) <- Keff

head(reservoir)


# add years - remember we are making up data for the same years that we have solar
reservoir$year <- profit_solar$year

# reorganize for easier analysis
reservoirg <- as.data.frame(reservoir) %>% pivot_longer(!year, names_to = "Keff", values_to = "power")
head(reservoirg)

# create profit from hydro
profit_hydro <- compute_profit_frompower(energy = reservoirg$power, year = reservoirg$year, price = 30, discount = 0.04)

names(profit_hydro)
```

## Plot
```{r powerresp, echo=TRUE}
# plot
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Net Present Value of Power in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year")
```


## Compare Profit from hydro/reservoir with solar{.scrollable}

we now have profit_hydro and profit_solar

```{r power2, echo=TRUE}

a <- ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Hydro", y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year")
b <- ggplot(profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Solar", y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year")
ggarrange(a, b)

# put on one graph
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year", title = "Both") +
  geom_boxplot(data = profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group = year), fill = "orange")

# or do get a nice legend
profit_hydro$etype <- "Hydro"
profit_solar$etype <- "Solar"
tmp <- rbind.data.frame(profit_hydro, profit_solar)
ggplot(tmp, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, fill = etype)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x = "Year", fill = "Power Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "orange"))
```

## Assignment 4 {.scrollable}

In your same groups -

-   Develop a profit model for your almond yield

-   (you can make this up - think about what the parameters would be)

-   you might assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly

-   there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions; you can have the profit function "call"/use the almond yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function)

-   Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters

-   Create 2 graphs
    - one that shows yield anomaly for each year, accounting for uncertainty in the parameters
    - one that show how yield anomaly in general vareies with your parameters

-   Write a short paragraph (in a Quatro document) to summarize you interpretation of your model results (e.g what do 'take away' from your model and sensitivity analysis)

Submit as a group: a Quatro document, your R files for almond yield and profit model on Canvas- Due Date Monday April 21
