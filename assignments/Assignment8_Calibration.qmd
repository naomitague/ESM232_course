## Assignment {.scrollable}

For the Sagehen model output and observated streamflow data
* create a performance metric that focuses on a feature of streamflow other than low flow metrics we looked at in class
* code that metric as a function
* apply the metric to the model output
* pick the 'best' performing parameter set
* graph the feature of streamflow that you are interested in for:
  * observed data
  * best performing parameter set
  * all parameter sets (as a light grey lines in the background)
  * all parameter sets whose performance is within 10% of the best performing parameter set (as darker lines in the background)

Submit as pdf (rendered Quarto), R file with your metric function - AND add your parameter set selection this shared spreadsheet
