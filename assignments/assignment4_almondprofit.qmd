# Assignment 4 - Almond Profit Model - Informal Sensitivity Analysis

In your same groups -

-   Develop a profit model for your almond yield (you can make this up - think about what the parameters would be)

    -   you might assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly

    -   there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions; you can have the profit function "call"/use the almond yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function)

-   Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters

-   Create a single graph of the results - you can decide what is the most meaningful graph

Submit as a group: pdf of rendered quarto including graph, your R files for almond yield and profit model,
