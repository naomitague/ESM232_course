# Model Goals


* understanding

* prediction

* communication

You are doing this all the time - there are many reasons to make this process explicit (computer aided modeling)


# Types of Model

There are many different ways to classify models

A *useful* classification looks at how models deal with space, time, and process 

Useful because the *type* of model will have implications for how you *build* and *use/run* the model



#  Stochastic - Deterministic 

Stochastic:  Model output is the probability of flood events of a magnitude greater than 500 m3/sec given rainfall probability distribution (artificial or generated from data) for a 100km2 watershed

Deterministic: Model output is the depth of flood given a rainfall event of 10cm over a 100km2 watershed

#  Lumped …Spatially distributed 

Lumped - single point in space, or space doesn’t matter

Spatially distributed - model is applied to different “patches” in space

* spatial units are independent

* spatial units interact with each other


```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/spatial.001.png")
```


# climate models are good examples

Resolution matters for spatial models


#  Static- Dynamic Time Varying 

Static - Processes or Variables modeled do not evolve with time

Dynamic - model elements evolve through time - and variables/results at one time step typically depends on previous time step


```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/temporal.001.png")
```

# Example of a time varying (dynamic) model

Modeling disease through time

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image13.png")
```




#  Abstract - Physically/Process based 

Abstract - relationship between inputs and output depends on parameters that don’t necessarily have a physical meaning - machine learning models are good examples 

Physically based - parameters do have a physical meaning (could be measured) - relationships derived from first principles (theory) of how things work

Think...simple bucket model
```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image4.jpeg")
```



# Pair and Share

With your conceptual model from Tuesday's class - 

* discuss what type of model you have 
* how might you translate/expand the basic conceptual models into different types of models - discuss that this might look like for your models



#  Basic components of models 


```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/model_basic.001.jpeg")
```

# How to start

* What are your inputs-outputs

* What’s in the box (the model itself) that gives you a relationship between outputs and inputs

* Transfer function

* Parameters, values that influences how the model relationships work


#  Types of Models

Conceptual.............Mathematical

Stochastic.............Deterministic

Lumped.............Spatially Distributed: *SPACE*

Static.............Dynamic  : *TIME*

Abstract.............Physically/Process Based

but biggest differences may often be the degree specific processes/parameters are accounted for



#  Types of models: Example 

* Input: Reservoir height (height) and flow rate (flow)
* Output: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

* Parameter: Reservoir Efficiency (K)

Conceptual model

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture3_conceptualmodels2/assets/img/reservoir_cm.001.jpeg")
```



#  Types of models: Example 

* **Input**: Reservoir height and flow rate

* **Output**: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

* **Parameters**: K Efficiency , ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity)

P = ρ * h * r * g * K Efficiency;

* P is Power in watts,
* ρ is the density of water (~1000 kg/m3)
* h is height in meters, 
* r is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
* g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2, 
* K Efficiency is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1.

This is a static (one point in time), deterministic, lumped (one place) model; its more or less physically based


#  Types of models: Example 

If we expand the model to output power production over a year, where inputs were streamflow for each day into the reservoir - *Dynamic Model*

If we expand to model power production from all the reservoirs in California, accounting for spatial patterns of snowmelt inputs and upstream-downstream relationships - *Spatially Distributed Model*

If we modified the model to estimate the probability distribution of power production, given a probability distribution of reservoir levels  - *Stochastic Model*



#  STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in  ES 

* Clearly define your goal (question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

* Develop a conceptual model - draw it, think about what type of model it is!

* <span style="color: red;">Design</span> or Select your model

* <span style="color: red;">Implement the model</span>

* Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

* Apply the model to the goal

* Communicate model results


#  <span style="color: red;">Design and Implement</span> Step 


* Translate conceptual model into functions (a single box or set of connected boxes) 
  * useful to diagram this (flow chart)

* Define inputs (data type, units)

* Define output (data type, units)

* Define model structure (mathematical representation of transfer functions)

* Choose programming language

* Write model

* Document the model  (meta data)

* Test model

#  Coding Concepts

* Any questions?

Learn by example

* Pay attention to the *documentation* and *syntax* of **compute_diversity.R**



#  Almond Yields


Lobell et al., 2006 used data to build models of tree crop yield for California that captured how
climate variation (place and time) might influence yield

* Yield anomaly

* Climate variables

Assumptions...as you work think about what these are...


# Assignment


 For this assignment you will work in pairs

Your goal is to implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate

* Inputs: daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation

* Outputs: maximum, minimum and mean yield anomoly for a input time series


The Lobell et al. 2006 paper will be the source for the transfer function that you will use in your model; specifically look at the equations in table 2.

# What you will do - Model Set Up

1. Draw diagram to represent your model - how it will translate inputs to outputs, with parameters that shape the relationship between inputs an outputs - on your diagram list what your inputs, parameters and outputs are with units

2.  Implement your diagram as an R function

Here are some ideas to think though. The climate data is going to need to be processed (e.g note that the model uses climate data from a particular month - you have ALL of the climate as daily data).  Here are two possible model outlines to follow

●      Almond_model <- function(clim_var1, clim_var2, parameters){……}

●      Almond_model <- function(clim, parameters){……}


The first example is where the climate variables are separately input into the function - climate data is processed beforehand as part of model set up

The second is where a climate data frame is the input in the function and you extract the useful data from it as part of the model. 


You can pick which option you prefer (or try both)

# Run the model

3.  Run your model for the **clim.txt** data that is posted on Canvas, 

**clim.txt** has the following columns 

these 4 columns tell you when climate observations were made 

* *day*
* *month*
* *year* 
* *wy* (water year) 


the next 3 columns are the climate observations

* maximum (*tmax_c*) daily temperature 
* minimum (*tmin_c*) daily temperature 
* precipitation (*precip*) on that day in mm

# check your work 

I will tell you that

* the maximum almond yield anomaly should be approximately 1920 ton/acre
* the lowest almond yield anomaly should be approximately -0.027 ton/acre
* the mean almond yield anomaly should be approximately 182 ton/acre


#  Notes

We will build on this on Tuesday's class 

* There are always multiple ways to code something in R;

* Remember that we want to strive for our code being as simple and streamline as possible. 

* Style counts. 
  * Make sure you choose meaningful variable names and add comments. 
  * Include comments at the top of the function to tell the user what the inputs/outputs are and their units and format.

# What to hand in on Canvas 

Two separate files (or a link to a repository with these files)

1. a R file that has your function definition
2. a Rmarkdown file that includes your conceptual model (embed as picture) and
shows how you applied the function to the test climate data (*clim.txt*)

# Grading Rubric

Conceptual model (20 pts)

  * a clear diagram that corresponds with your R function (10 pts)
  * inputs and output and parameters shown on the diagram (10 pts)
  
R Implementation (30 pts)

  * correct function implementation (*.R file)  (10 pts)
  * application of the function to **clim.txt** (in Rmarkdown file) (10 pts)
