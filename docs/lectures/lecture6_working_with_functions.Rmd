## Building models with blocks - functions that call other functions


Functions can always embed other functions - and in models the output of one model may be the input to another

* loosely coupled models - output from one becomes input the other - but not necessarily automatic
* fully coupled - models exchange input sna outputs (feedback systems)

Develop a conceptual model

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
include_graphics("./power_comparison_figure.jpeg",) 
```


To start - lets create what we need to compute net present value of power facility
We will use output from our solarpv function as input into a function that
estimate profit given a price - and also 'calls' another function to compute 
net present value

```{r valuep}

source("../R/compute_NPV.R")
source("../R/compute_profit_frompower.R")

compute_profit_frompower

compute_NPV

# use solar from  site1 from above as input

profit_solar = compute_profit_frompower(energy=site2df$elect, year=site2df$year, price=30, discount=0.04)
profit_solar

ggplot(profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Profit in current $", x="year")

# notice that by graphing we identify an issue with the first year
# thoughts on what it might be
```

# Putting it all together

now lets add both of our functions (hydro and solar power), together with computing profit and sensitivity analysis to create a full picture of power options


Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as **compute_profit_frompower** for both sources of power
(such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete model

```{r reuse}

# rerun 'sampling' in using_data_with_functions.Rmd. above to get results from our reserovir model

# lets start with hydro power
source("../R/power_gen.R")

# we are 'making up' inputs for hydro power - to have it match the number of year 
# that we had solar values for, lets sets the number of runs equal to the number of years

number_runs = length(site2_average$year)

reservoir_model_res= as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=number_runs, ncol=3))
colnames(reservoir_model_res)=c("height","flow","power")

# STep 2 - generate heights and flow rates
reservoir_model_res$height = rnorm(mean=10, sd=1, n=number_runs)
reservoir_model_res$flow = runif(min=0.1, max=1, n=number_runs)

# Step 3 - generate uncertainty due to reservoir efficiency, lets assume that 
# we know its somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7
Keff = runif(min=0.4, max=0.7, n=20)

# Step 3 - apply model to get power for each height, flow rate (each year), across
# uncertainty in efficiency
res = Keff %>% map_dfc(~power_gen( height=reservoir_model_res$height, flow=reservoir_model_res$flow, Keff=.x) )
colnames(res)=Keff

head(res)

# add years - remember we are making up data for the same years that we have solar
res$year = site2_average$year

# reorganize for easier analysis 
resg=as.data.frame(res) %>% pivot_longer(!year,names_to="Keff", values_to="power")
head(res)

# create profit from hydro
profit_hydro = compute_profit_frompower(energy=resg$power, year= resg$year, price=30, discount=0.04)

names(profit_hydro)

# plot
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()

# compare with solar
a=ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(title="Hydro",y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year")
b=ggplot(profit_solar, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(title="Solar", y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year")

# put on one graph
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(year, netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Net Present Values in 1945 Dollars", x="Year", title="Both") +
